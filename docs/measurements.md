# Measurement Definitions

## Single Stream Throughput

The maximum AVG FPS for a single stream and single pipeline runner process.

## Stream Density

The maximum number of streams that can be processed at the `target-fps` in parallel.

The `target-fps` can be calculated per stream (all streams must reach
the target) or by overall average (the average FPS over all streams
must reach the target).
