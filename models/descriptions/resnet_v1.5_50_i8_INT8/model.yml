description: >-
  ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep.
  ResNet50 v1.5 is the modified version of the original ResNet50 model. 
  ResNet50 v1.5 is slightly more accurate (0.5%) and slightly lower performance (down by 5%) compared to ResNet50.
  https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/benchmarks/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/README.md
  
  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in RGB
  order.

  The model output is the image class indicating the recognized image.
